# Lab repository

At this repository I will keep all scripts and source code that I will
be eventually writing whenever studying a programming language or
anything related.

This repository will consist of a bunch of folders where each of them
will be named after the programming language being studied.

To keep track of all features being learned, a README file will be used
to organize the topics being worked. This way, I can use this repository
as a fast way to remember what I have studied.

What I have so far:
1. Vim

All that is done here is better explained at 
[my website](https://rafaelpcarneiro.github.io/)
